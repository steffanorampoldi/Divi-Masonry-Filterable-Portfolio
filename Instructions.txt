I took the liberty of optimizing the Masonry Portfolio style code created by Divi Soup by adding a custom CSS enhancement: now the title of each item smoothly appears when hovering the mouse over the image.
I share this contribution because, until now, the Divi Soup solution remains the only solid option to make the portfolio work with a Masonry layout in Divi, and I believe this CSS adaptation can further enrich the user experience and overall presentation.

/*-------Masonry Filterable Portfolio Layout by Divi Soup-------*/
/*--------------------------------------------------------------*/

This masonry layout is designed to work with the standard Divi filterable portfolio module.

***For this to work correctly, you must have some projects set up with featured images and those projects must be assigned to a category***

Instructions:

- Import the .json file into a new page (not the library)

- Open the portfolio module and select the categories you want to display

- If you wish, you can move the JS code to Divi > Theme Options > Integration > Add to head and the CSS to your child theme stylesheet or Divi > Theme Options > General > Custom CSS or you can leave it where it is.

- As this uses the fullwidth layout option in the design settings (as opposed to grid), Divi will load your fullsize images which can slow your page down. To rectify this, add the code included in the php.text file to the functions.php file in your child theme, your thumbnails will then load at a maximum of 400px wide.
