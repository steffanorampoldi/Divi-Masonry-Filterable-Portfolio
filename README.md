# Divi-Masonry-Filterable-Portfolio
I took the liberty of optimizing the Masonry Portfolio style code created by Divi Soup, incorporating a visual enhancement: now the title of each item appears when hovering the mouse over the image.
I share this contribution because, until now, the Divi Soup solution remains the only solid option to make the portfolio work with a Masonry layout in Divi, and I believe this adaptation can enrich the user experience and presentation.
